# CHARUSAT-AMS (Attendance Management System)

This application was developed as a project for the third semester of my B.Tech programme.

The main intent behind the development of this project was to digitalize the process of taking attendance in a classroom.
The falculty would enter certain details as Class, Date, Subject... which would generate the required list of students which the professor can mark present or absent.
He can then regenerate this attendance report whenever he requires by feeding in the same details he had taken the attendance for.
